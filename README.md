This repository houses UNC Coding Bootcamp Homework Assignment 6, a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

It uses:

- HTML to create the static structure of the app

- CSS to style the app

- JavaScript and jQuery to dynamically generate and update the HTML and CSS, as well as calling the OpenWeatherMap API and adding event listeners

- The day.js library to pull and format the correct dates
